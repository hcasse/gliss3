===== Generation Process =====

  - parsing (PF) -- produces an IRG representation (mostly bijective with the sources), instruction stays in their source original form;
  - instantiation (IF) -- the actual whole set of instructions (WSI) is generated, mode and operation parameters are developed to the leaf actual parameters;
  - generation (GF) -- GEP works mainly as a templater system taking as input the IRG and the WSI to generate files for the simulator.

The generation phase involves lot of transformation and analysis of the IRG and WSI:
  * building the fetch tree (to find back quickly the instruction identifier),
  * building the decoding functions (that extracts parameters from the instruction in binary form) and may involve complex parameter decoding,
  * simulation code generation that translate SimNML action to C code requiring support of bit operations, functional expressions, aliasing support, type equivalence, type operation translation, etc.


===== Typing System =====

Typing must be checked as soon as possible in the compilation process to maintain the error flow
synchronized with the source (for the human user understanding). Yet, SimNML may prevent this
as symbols like modes or operations may not be declared before being used, especially for OR modes
or operations whose references are usually put after.

Therefore, two typing phases would be valuable:
  * during front-end, but partial as some types are not available at this time (creation of any_type typing),
  * after front-end, once all types are defined.

The second phase is not very well supported by the current GLISS version and should be applied
after the building on all instructions (instantiation of parameters).

Below are the applied typing rules:

C |- nothing => nothing: no_type
C |- const(t, c) => const(t, c)
C |- ref(_, i) => ref(C[i], i)

c |- unop(_, _, no_type) => error
C |- unop(_, _, e: STRING) => error
C |- unop(_, NEG, e: enum(r)) => unop(t, NEG, coerce(t, e)) /\ t = card(log2(max(r) + 1)
C |- unop(_, NEG, e: t) => unop(t, NEG, e: t)
C |- unop(_, INV, e: float(_)) => error
C |- unop(_, INV, e: fixed(_)) => error
C |- unop(_, INV, e: enum(r)) => unop(t, INV, coerce(t, e)) /\ t = card(log2(max(r) + 1)
C |- unop(_, INV, e: t) => unop(t, INV, e: t)
C |- unop(_, NOT, e: bool) => unop(bool, NOT, e)
C |- unop(_, NOT, e: t) => unop(bool, NOT, binop(t, EQ, const(t, 0)))



Used function includes:
max(r) = maximum value ranges.

===== Coercing and casting =====

Order on types, t1 > t2 defined by:
any_type > _
float(n, m) > float(n', m') if m > m' \/ (m = m' /\ n > n')
float(_) > _
fixed(n, m) > fixed(n', m') if n > n' \/ (n = n' /\ m > m')
fixed(n, m) > int(n') if n >= n'
fixed(n, m) > card(n') if n >= n'
int(n) > int(n') if n > n'
int(n) > bool
card(n) > card(n') if n > n'
card(n) > bool
int(n) > card(n') if n >= n'
card(n) > int(n') if n > n'
int(n) > enum(rs) if n >= log2(max(rs)) + 2
card(n) > enum(rs) if n >= log2(max(rs)) + 1

CAST operation is a bit-to-bit copy from one value to another one:
CAST(float(n, m), v: float(n', m')) =


===== Identification Generation Process =====

Identifier is derived from "syntax" attribute taking
the format or the string and performing transformations below
to get a valid C identifier:

^ Input ^ Output ^
| ' ' | "_" |
| '\t' | "_" |
| '#' | "_I" |
| ',' | "_" |
| '{' | "_LB_" |
| '}' | "_RB_" |
...


===== Smart Opcode Generation =====

After instantiation, the instruction opcode is defined by a format expression
"format"(fmt, a0, a1, ..., an-1). Each ai must match a %b argument in fmt given
the size (in bits) of argument. a0, a1, ..., an-1 are expression whose variable
can only be instructions parameters.

This leads to several complex issues when we need to decode a machine instruction:
  * how to rebuild parameter if they involved in complex expression
or may be spread over several for mat arguments?
  * how to handle parameter whose type is not full (does not fulfill the full range of bits
matching %b) like ranges or enumerated  type?

For both issues, GLISS proposes smart solutions that are described below.

==== Sparse Format Argument ====

A format argument field is of the form %nf where is the number of bits occupied
by the matching argument. Basically, all n bits are encoding the argument for most
of argument types, that is word values between 0 and 2^n - 1. Yet, GLISS provide
sparse type like range or enumeration that only use a part of interval [0, 2^n - 1].
Unfortunately, the fetch tree generator (see below) does not support this feature
and this would make it unnecessarily complex to make it. Instead, we propose
to decompose an instruction containing sparse type in as many instruction as needed
to cover the possible argument values. In fact, the same instruction (from the point
of view of user will match different range of decoding in the fetch tree.

This is done in two steps:
  - when an instruction contains parameters of type range or enumerate, the exhaustive
list of possible opcodes is built,
  - using a modified Quine - MacCluskey and to minimize the size of the fetch tree,
the list is reduced as much as possible by grouping opcodes whose bit argument values
are complementary.

Phase (1) is quite simple for a op whose parameters are p1, ..., pn and format
is format(f, a1, a2, ..., an).

<algo>
ALGORITHM: 	Opcode List Building
INPUT: 		a1, a2, ..., an arguments of format.
OUTPUT: 	list of format with no more range parameters.

l <- { (a1, a2, ..., an) }
FOREACH pi: t s.t. t = range(a, b) or t = enum(v1, ...) DO
	FOREACH w IN t DO
		l <- { (a1', ..., ai', an') / (a1, ..., an) in l /\ forall i: 1 <= i <= n -> a'i = ai[pi -> w] }
result <- { (f', a1', ..., am') / forall i: 1 <= n <= n: ai constant -> f'[%f -> ai] /\ forall i: 0  <= 1 <= m -> a1' not constant }

</algo>

Phase 2 is a bit more complex. At this level, a format is made of of 0, 1, X and
is extended to _. The merge U operation has the following definition:

^ a U b ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ X ^ _ ^
^     0 | 0 | X | _ | X |
^     1 | X | 1 | _ | X |
^     X | _ | _ | X | _ |
^     _ | X | X | _ | _ |

<algo>
ALGORITHM:	Pseudo-Quine-MacCluskey Minimization
INPUT:		l list of formats.
OUTPUT:		done: minimize list of formats.

	todo <- l
	done <- {}
	WHILE todo <> {} DO

		%% build groups
		pgroups <- { }
		groups <- { (m, {m}) / m in todo }
		WHILE groups <> pgroups DO
			pgroups <- groups
			groups <- { (U{(mi, si) in M} mi, U{(mi, si) in M} si)
				/ forall (mi, si), (mj, sj) in M -> |mi U mj|_x - |mi|_x <= 1 }
		DONE

		%% select a group
		let (M, S) s.t. (M, S) in groups /\ forall (m, s) in groups, |S| >= |s|
		done <- { M }
		todo <- todo - { G }

</code>

Now, we can present the last step of code opcode generation with sparse opcode arguments.
Some instruction set (for instance, ARM9) are re-using rarely used or unconsistent opcodes
to encore special instruction. In this case, a non-used opcode is not only a range
or an enumerated parameter but a conjunction of different parameter values. Clearly,
the goal is to select allowed opcode for an instruction controlled  by a condition and the
obtained opcodes are feeded to Pseudo-Quine-MacCluskey Minimization algorithm. Yet, we
have to extend a bit algorithm Opcode List Building to support conditional selection of
opcodes.

First, we precise the supported expression form for an opcode O:
<code>
O:		none
|		format(f, a1, ..., an)
|		if(Ep, O, O)
</code>
Ep is the set of expresson whose variable can only be instruction parameters.

Now, we want to get the list of opcodes s.t. we can evaluate a condition to select
a subset of opcodes. We define the function S: O x Ep -> 2^W.

<algo>
ALGORITHM:	Opcode Selection by Condition
INPUT:		Instruction with parameter pi and opcode o.
OUTPUT:		S[o] c

S[none] _ = { }
S[if(c', o1, o2)] c = S[o1] (c /\ c') U S[o2] (c /\ -c')
S[format(f, a1, ..., an)] T =
	{ (f, a'1, ..., a'n) / let sub = { pi -> w / pi:t /\ (t = range \/ t = enum) /\ w in range(t) } in
						   forall a'i: a'i = sub a_i }
S[format(f, a1, ..., an)] c =
	{ (f, a'1, ..., a'n) / let sub = { pi -> w / pi:t /\ (t = range \/ t = enum \/ pi in var(c)) /\ w in range(t) } in
						   forall a'i: a'i = sub a_i /\ I[sub c]}
</algo
Where I est the interpretation of its argument, I: E -> W, and sub is a subsitution in the expression of SimNML, sub: E -> E.


==== Complex Decoding ====

Most of ISA maintain a direct transformation between instruction parameter, as seen by the assembly developer,
and the encoding of the parameter in the opcode (so we have an identity function for encoding or decoding).
Sometimes, things may be more complex:
  * a paremeter may be split over several opcode fields,
  * calculation is needed to encode/decode the parameter (shift, addition, etc).

In this case, we have encoding and decoding functions that are not identities but both functions have an
important property: there are bijective. Lets go further in the encoding and decoding process.

An instruction may be seen as a mnemonic with a set of parameters p1, ..., pn. An opcode is a string of bits
with some %b bits whose value depends on parameters using argument expression to map pi to %b. So, we can define
the set of encoding and decoding functions:

enc: W x pi -> W	where each X is replaced by the matching argument.
dec: W x W -> pi	where each pi is built from bits of the opcode.

Implement enc si straight-forward once we have a value xi for each parameter pi,
let sub = { pi -> xi } the substitution of pi by xi, encoding is the evaluation of ai
and replacement in format word:
env w pi = format(w, a'i) / a'i = sub ai

Decoding is more complex because we have to retrieve any bit of pi from the encoded word,
that is, more or less, inverting ai expressions.

Let w<ui..li> part of opcode matching argument ai. ai contains one or several references
to a part or a whole of pi. The goal of this algorithm is to produce a list of
equalities of the form pi<vi..ki> in function of w<ui..li>. pi are then recomposed
from the definition of their different fragments.

<algo>
ALGORITHM:	Paramater Decoding
INPUT:		w<ui..li> field of opcode, pi list of parameter.
RESULT:		pi<vi..ki>, fragments of parameters.

result = U{ai} II[ai] w<ui..li>
with II: Ep x W -> 2^(ID, Ep)

II[pi] w = (pi, w)
II[e + k] w = II[e] (w - k)
II[e1::e2] w<u..l> = II[e1] w<u..s+l> U II[e2] <s+l-1..l> with s = |type(e)|

%% TO FIX
II[e<u..l>] w = { (pi<..>, wi<min(ui - (li - l)..max(l, li)>) / (pi<ui..li>, wi) in II[e] w }
II[_] w = error

</algo>
